    "## Basics of making a Glyph\n",
    "\n",
    "The glyph is essentially a function that takes two arguments:\n",
    "* `x: float` – the glyph parameter, a number between 0.0 and 100.0\n",
    "* `canvas: mg.Canvas` – the canvas object, where the glyph is to be drawn\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def empty_glyph(x: float, canvas: mg.Canvas) -> None:\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "```\n",
    "## Showing the glyph\n",
    "\n",
    "`mg.show(my_glyph)` shows a few versions of the glyph at different parameter values (by default 10, 30, 50, 70, 90).\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional arguments of mg.show() are:\n",
    "* `x=[[10, 50, 90], [5, 6]]` - specifies which glyph sizes to show. A number like `x=50` asks for showing one size. A list of numbers `x=[20, 50, 80]` shows a row of glyphs with the sizes. An aray of lists shows multiple rows with specifies sizes.\n",
    "* `shadow=True` - show the shadow so that one can see where the glyph itself ends.  `True` by default.\n",
    "* `background='whitesmoke'` - background of the compound image with multiple glyphs.\n",
    "* `scale=2.5` - scales the rendered size.  Higher scales (such as 10) are good for examining details for making samples into slides and publications.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Drawing a line: `canvas.line()`\n",
    "\n",
    "`canvas.line((x1, y1), (x2, y2))` draws a line. There are a few optional arguments for customizing the line:\n",
    "* `width='15p'` – sets the line width.  `'15p'` stands for 15 per mille, size relative to the total glyph size.\n",
    "* `linecap='round'` – sets the shape of the line ends. Possible line ends: `'butt'`, `'round'`, `'square'`\n",
    "* `color='blue'` – sets the color. The colors can be for example: [`'darkslateblue'`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/named-color), `'#483d8b'` is the same color as a hex code, `(0.282, 0.239, 0.545)` is the same color as a triplet of RGB values, and `(0.282, 0.239, 0.545, 0.4)` has 40% alpha (the color is semi-transparent).\n",
